C program For infix to Postfix with very easy logic for beginner 

The program is tested and is working absolutely fine . The logic behind the program is the operator is given a key value which is based on priority . If the lower or equal prioirty operator arrives it pops out the stack values of operator in array while rest is pushed into the stack.

Once the dollarr is encountered it pops out all the operator from stack and store into array.
